         <h5>What is it about?</h5>
         <p>
           Within Digital Design, there is a hyperfocus on usability, straightforwardness, minimalism, and clarity. While making sure that all experiences with technology are inclusive and accessible to all who use it will always be an important priority, life is full of unique, fuzzy and intuitive experiences. Our digital devices have grown to exert greater and greater influence on our interactions with them, molding our hands and bodies to their needs. No matter if it’s a computer, digital software or code—How can we mold these technologies back and make it a conversation instead of a power dynamic?
         </p>
         <p>
           Over the course of the past five weeks, students have explored questions like:
         </p>
         <ul>
           <li>What are alternative visions for computers?</li>
           <li>How can computers be a tool that supports the community and pushes back against productivity driven metrics?</li>
           <li>What are the effects of the internet's networked culture on identity?</li>
           <li>What are commonalities between bodies and computers? Both in how systems treat them and in how they can be morphed?</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
