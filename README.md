# The Technology that U + I Can(’t) Reach

Within Digital Design, there is a hyperfocus on usability, straightforwardness, minimalism, and clarity. While making sure that all experiences with technology are inclusive and accessible to all who use it will always be an important priority, life is full of unique, fuzzy and intuitive experiences. Our digital devices have grown to exert greater and greater influence on our interactions with them, molding our hands and bodies to their needs. No matter if it’s a computer, digital software or code—How can we mold these technologies back and make it a conversation instead of a power dynamic?
