            Weekly Description
          </h3>
          <p>
            Over the weeks, we've moved from Computer to Software to Internet, looking at how they impact human expression, creative and identity. This final week will focus on how viewing the body as a computer can change our perspective on the technologies that impact it.

              As opposed to previous weeks where we're all working through the same content together, this week students will be broken up into three groups of 4. Each group will start at a specific station and every <strong>40 minutes</strong> will cycle to a new station. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Please review the different station and their instructions below! We will call for a break after the second cycle has been complete.
