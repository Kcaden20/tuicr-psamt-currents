                  All our readings and presentation points towards a modular and boundless way towards expressing ourselves. For the final project of this class, we'll be grappling with the themes of the presentation and the reading head on. You will be researching, creating assets and making a first draft of what a new networked identity, expressed through code and software would look like for you. <br><br> This will be a two week project, we'll be using this coming week to create, make assets and bring in a first draft.

                    <li>What is Legacy defining as a "Glitch"?</li>
                    <li>What are the social pressures that have forged the shape of your identity? Be specific. <em>(i.e gender pressures, social pressures, familial pressures)</em></li>
                    <li>What parts of the forge were placed on you without consent? How do those make you feel? </li>
                    <li>How are you perpetuating existing systems of expression? What are your biases?</li>
                    <li>If we start thinking about identity in a modular way, moving away from the center and towards where <em>glitches</em> exist, how would you change?</li>
                    <li>If you are happy with who you are and how you are, what are some things you'd want to experiment with about yourself?</li>

                  Next, think through how you want to represent those changes. Do you want to build it those changes to your identity with HyperText? Do you want to create visuals that represent the new parts of this identity?
