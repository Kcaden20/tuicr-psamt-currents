            Now having spoken about the computer itself, let's narrow the scope to the tools that exist inside shed—Computer Software. Instead of focusing on the decisions that lead software to look the way it does, we'll instead be looking at how software could've been different.

                <li>
                  Students will be split up into groups of two. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  You will speak to each other about your takes on a speculative computer with each partner having 10 minutes or so. Here are some points you can talk about: 
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>What would you like to add to it? </li>
                  <li>What doesn’t feel entirely done at the moment? </li>
                  <li> How did you incorporate the reading and video from last week?</li>
                  <li>If one of you did not read or watch it <em>ask your partner to summarize</em>, and collaborate on how the computer could be changed with the material in mind.</li>
                  <li>If both of you did not read or watch, please take the moment to read <a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/">A Brief Rant on The Future of Interaction</a>, and talk through how each of your computers could change.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Be sure to jot down whatever feedback is being given to each person's computers during the time alloted.</li>
                <li>When it is time to switch, post the annotated feedback under that person's post on the CANVAS thread.</li>
              </ol>

              <h5>Class Discussion</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>We will reconvene into a larger group.</li>
                <ul>
                <li> We will use post-it notes to write down what came up for everyone in their groups</li>
                <li>There should be one idea per post-it note</li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                  We'll talk through some of the points on the post it notes.

                  While SmallTalk and HyperCard are programmatic ways to think of interconnected software, there is a less technical and more amorphous way to connect unrelated tools, by becoming these links ourselves.

              <h5>Bending Software To You</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>You will be assigned one of the following office suite programs to use as an initial creative outlet: </li>
                  <ol>
                    <li> Google Docs </li>
                    <li>Google Slides</li>
                    <li>Google Sheets</li>
                    <li>Google Drive</li>
                    <li>Google Calendar</li>
                    <li>Google Forms </li>
                  </ol>
<li>Here are some guiding questions to help you think through repurposing the software you've been given.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>We'll take 5 minutes to survey the software you've been assigned</li>
                    <li>What are the options of the software? What are you able to edit?</li>
            <li>Does it let you draw? Change colors? Change styling? </li>
                    <li>How can its options be used for artistic expression? Bend the Software to your interests. <em>(i.e turning a phone tree into a listen-and-dial horror game)</em></li>
                  </ul>
                </ol>

              <h5>Becoming SmallTalk</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>Look through the <a href="https://tinytools.directory">Tiny Tools Directory</a></li>
                <p>
                  Pick a software that you feel piques your interest. 
                </p>
                <li>Create a connection between the work you did  in the previous software and this new software you're making.</li>
                <li>Here are some guiding questions:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Is what you made in your previous program exportable in some way?</li>
                  <li>Can that export be brought into the your new software?</li>
                  <li>If not, what are some ways it can be reintrepreted, add to it or be pulled back into the original software?</li>
                </ul>
              </ol>

                  Everything we've been through this week is about software and how it could be connected in more dynamic ways.  </li>
                    <li> What all these connections and the materials we've gone over point towards is that through networks, a greater level of expression and identity can be achieved.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    Read and Watch the materials above:

                  <ul>
                    <li> What are the connections being made?</li>
                    <li>How is it changing your experience of each of the parts involved in the connection?</li>
                    <li>What points from Olia Lialina's article do you agree with?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    Afterward, you're going to think through the following:
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>What are 5 different metaphors that feels natural to you? </li>
                    <li>Choose one and think through these parts for it:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>What is the physical peripheral, shape or tool that is used to bend software towards you?</li>
                      <li>Give a list of the software you'd want it to connect between: </li>
                      <li><em>I'm going to challenge you to choose software that isn't all from one company or one type of software (i.e not just entirely Adobe or entirely creative software.)</em></li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Give a final polished look to what the final peripheral looks like. </li>
                  <li><em>I'm going to also challenge you to represent it in a different manner than last week's homework.</em></li>
                  <li> Mock up an example of what work coming out of the connections would look like.
<li>Submit Via the Canvas Thread.</li>
                  <li>Look through the Presentation from earlier for more resources and references.</li>
