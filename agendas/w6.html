          <p>
            This week will be a introduction to our course. We'll get closer to
            our peers, you'll get to know more about your instructor. We'll
            start by talking about the computer. Why does it look like it does?
            How could it look different? What would you make it look like?

                <p>
                  You and your teammates will be asked to find 10 things you have in common with one another. The things you have in common should get more and more specific as you have you get towards ten.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Do not be repetitive with the things in Common!
                </p>
                <p>
                  They should all not be a version of the same statement. (i.e All ten things are a variation of "We like (insert 10 different artist names here.)")

                We will put them into a google document for all of us to sign.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Discuss what you know about the history of the land we’re
                    all on right now. Examples of discussion points might
                    include the names of indigenous nations, names of treaties
                    or settlement agreements, other historical events in the
                    area.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Describe a place that is important to you. What makes it so
                    special?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    How would you feel if you were no longer about to access
                    this place? How would you feel if this special place was
                    destroyed?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This isn’t just a historical event, people are being
                    displaced right now so if anyone annot answer this, that is
                    okay. How would you feel if this place was destroyed and
                    remade to fit someone else's vision?
