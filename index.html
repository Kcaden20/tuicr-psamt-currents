        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Within Digital Design, there is a hyperfocus on usability,
          straightforwardness, minimalism, and clarity. While making sure that
          all experiences with technology are inclusive and accessible to all
          who use it will always be an important priority, life is full of
          unique, fuzzy and intuitive experiences. Our digital devices have
          grown to exert greater and greater influence on our interactions with
          them, molding our hands and bodies to their needs. No matter if it’s a
          computer, digital software or code—How can we mold these technologies
          back and make it a conversation instead of a power dynamic?
        </p>
        <p>
          This course will be interested in addressing questions such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
           <li>What are alternative visions for computers?</li>
           <li>How can computers be a tool that supports the community and pushes back against productivity driven metrics?</li>
           <li>What are the effects of the internet's networked culture on identity?</li>
           <li>What are commonalities between bodies and computers? Both in how systems treat them and in how they can be morphed?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Over the course of this five week workshop, we will be exploring <em>The
          Technology that User + Interface Can(’t) Reach</em> and <em>the The Technology
          that You + I Can Reach.</em>

        <h3>University, College, and Program Policies</h3>
        <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
        <p>
          Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences,
          including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure
          of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning,
          disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal
          from the university. Students are responsible for understanding the
          University’s policy on academic honesty and integrity and must make
          use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating,
          presenting, and performing their work, taking examinations, and doing
          research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures
          specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately
          differentiating their own work from that of others. The full text of
          the policy, including adjudication procedures, is found at
          <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/policies/ "
            >http://www.newschool.edu/policies/</a
          >
          . Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be
          found on the Learning Center’s website:
          <a
            href="http://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/student-resources/"

          >
        </p>

        <h4>Student Responsibility</h4>
        <p>
          Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent.
          Late papers, failure to complete the readings assigned for class
          discussion, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions and
          presentations will jeopardize your successful completion of this
          course.
        </p>
        <h4>Class Delays</h4>
        <p>
          In rare instances, instructors may be delayed for synchronous
          sessions. If they have not joined by the time the session is scheduled
          to start, you must wait a minimum of thirty minutes for their arrival.
          In the event that they will miss a session entirely, an announcement
          will be made on Canvas indicating any work that should be completed
          before the next synchronous session.
        </p>
        <h4>Open Source Policy</h4>
        <p>
          You are encouraged to help each other out with programming, but unless
          otherwise specified you must turn in your own work. Initially it is
          expected that you will be coding from scratch without re-using or
          modifying other people’s code. After midterm reuse and modification of
          code will be allowed, but only under very strict terms.
          Copying/pasting and reusing code is a key part of the programming
          process, especially while learning. You often learn best by modifying
          working examples rather than starting from scratch. We stand on the
          shoulders of giants; that’s the essence of the open-source philosophy.
          However, there is a very important caveat: any open-source code you
          borrow and/or modify must be labeled as such. That is, you must
          include, in your work, the name of the author, the source URL, the
          types of open-source license, and you must make clear which lines of
          code are not yours. If you fail to do this, you will fail the class.
          It is very, very easy to get this right, though, so if you take a
          moment’s time to label your work correctly, you will not have a
          problem. Just be diligent and honest.
